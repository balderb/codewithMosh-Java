# codewithMosh-Java

## Start of personal coding notes during this course "codingwithMosh"

### Overview of this first class i'm documenting: "classes" 

Classes:

#### Encapsulation
#### Abstraction
#### Constructors
#### Getters / Setters
#### Method Overloading

Let's follow and make notes! 

class = a blueprint for creating objects
object = an instance of a class

those two are fundamentally different

Look at the example class car.java inside the classes package.
