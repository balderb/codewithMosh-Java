# codewithMosh-Java

## Start of personal coding notes during this course "codingwithMosh"

### Overview of this first class i'm documenting: "classes" 

Classes:

#### Encapsulation
#### Abstraction
#### Constructors
#### Getters / Setters
#### Method Overloading

Let's follow and make notes! 

class = a blueprint for creating objects
object = an instance of a class

those two are fundamentally different

Look at the example class car.java inside the classes package.

## keywords:

UML: unified modeling language - basically the language we use to visualize classes and their state and behavior.

## examples:

car.java
lamp.java

inside of realsoftwareclass package we define a real usable software class like a "textbox".
